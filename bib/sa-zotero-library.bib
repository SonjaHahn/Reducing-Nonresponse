  abstract = {Data driven pedagogy has been introduced into Australian schools over the last decade to improve student learning outcomes, but are teacher educators preparing preservice teachers to be data literate? We used a survey to investigate ready-to-graduate preservice teachers' beliefs regarding their knowledge and skills in data literacy. Before entering a course on data literacy their belief responses indicated that they had basic data interpretation knowledge, but they were unsure of how to translate that knowledge into the classroom to improve student outcomes. The survey was administered again after a data literacy course, which included a five-week supervised professional experience task of observing data being used in schools to drive pedagogy. The post-course survey responses showed students increased confidence in their ability to interpret and use data, suggesting that a data literacy course linked to the professional experience task improves teachers' sense of preparedness to use data in the classroom.},

  abstract = {This article draws upon research in one school in Queensland, Australia, to explore how the push to data influences teacher work and subsequent student learning. This `rise of data', often oriented towards `external' and performative processes of accountability, exhibits itself in many ways, but is particularly evident in teachers' engagement with various forms of regionally and centrally sanctioned, and often standardized, measures of attainment, typically expressed in numbers. Drawing upon the sociology of numbers, and Pierre Bourdieu's concepts of `field', `habitus' and `capital', the research shows how the emphasis upon data collection reveals a `field of schooling practices' characterized by concerns about collecting, analysing and improving numeric data; standardized and centrally sanctioned data as forms of capital of increasing value; and a teaching disposition/habitus characterized by constant monitoring of student performance through virtual and physical data bases. The research reveals how the `logics' of schooling may be in danger of being dominated by more centralized, standardized forms of numeric data for performative accountability purposes, even as more educative logics are evident.},

  abstract = {In an era of mass migration, social scientists, populist parties and social movements raise concerns over the future of immigration-destination societies. What impacts does this have on policy and social solidarity? Comparative cross-national research, relying mostly on secondary data, has findings in different directions. There is a threat of selective model reporting and lack of replicability. The heterogeneity of countries obscures attempts to clearly define data-generating models. P-hacking and HARKing lurk among standard research practices in this area.This project employs crowdsourcing to address these issues. It draws on replication, deliberation, meta-analysis and harnessing the power of many minds at once. The Crowdsourced Replication Initiative carries two main goals, (a) to better investigate the linkage between immigration and social policy preferences across countries, and (b) to develop crowdsourcing as a social science method. The Executive Report provides short reviews of the area of social policy preferences and immigration, and the methods and impetus behind crowdsourcing plus a description of the entire project. Three main areas of findings will appear in three papers, that are registered as PAPs or in process.},

  abstract = {Solar energy has become an important renewable energy source for reducing the use of fossil fuels and to mitigate global warming, for which solar collectors constitute a technology that is to be promoted. The use of nanofluids can increase the efficiency of solar into thermal energy conversion in solar collectors. Experimental values for the specific heat, thermal conductivity and viscosity of alumina/water nanofluids are needed to evaluate the influence of the solid content (from 0.25 to 5 v\%) and the flow rate on the Reynolds, Nusselt and the heat transfer coefficient. In the laminar flow regime, thermal conductivity enhancement over specific heat decrement is key parameter, and a 2.34\% increase in the heat transfer coefficient is theoretically obtained for 1 v\% alumina nanofluid. To corroborate the results, experimental tests were run in a flat plate solar collector. A reduction in efficiency from 47\% to 41.5\% and a decrease in the heat removal factor were obtained using the nanofluid due to the formation of a nanoparticle deposition layer adding an addition thermal resistance to heat transfer. Nanofluids are recommended only if the nanoparticle concentration is high enough to enhance thermal conductivity, but no so high so as to avoid wall deposition.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the number of studies using a cluster-randomized design has grown dramatically. In addition, the cluster-randomized crossover design has been touted as a methodological advance that can increase efficiency of cluster-randomized studies in certain situations. While the cluster-randomized crossover trial has become a popular tool, standards of design, analysis, reporting and implementation have not been established for this emergent design. We address one particular aspect of cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover trial design: estimating statistical power. We present a general framework for estimating power via simulation in cluster-randomized studies with or without one or more crossover periods. We have implemented this framework in the clusterPower software package for R, freely available online from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Our simulation framework is easy to implement and users may customize the methods used for data analysis. We give four examples of using the software in practice. The clusterPower package could play an important role in the design of future cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover studies. This work is the first to establish a universal method for calculating power for both cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized clinical trials. More research is needed to develop standardized and recommended methodology for cluster-randomized crossover studies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This article takes the view that the student teachers' assumptions regarding the concept of theory affect how they engage with theory during initial teacher education. Using a qualitative approach, this study examines student teachers' conceptualizations of the nature and role of theory in teacher education. The results indicate conflicts between student teachers' assumptions about theory in general and pedagogical theories in particular, and also between a narrow conception of the nature of theory and a more nuanced understanding of the purpose of theory. Student teachers' encounter with pedagogy as an academic discipline\textemdash{}with a different epistemology than the one they know from their discipline-specific studies\textemdash{} seems to cause considerable struggle that often ends in a devaluation and denigration of theory in teacher education.

In this study, university students (n = 119) solved three tasks that greatly differed in complexity. Their learning processes were captured in detail by task-specific questionnaires and computer-generated log files. Results indicate that students adapted almost all learning processes significantly to task complexity. For example, students accessed more hypertext pages for complex tasks than for simple tasks. However, this kind of adaptation was not consistently related to performance. For variables capturing learners' self-regulation, such as the number of accessed hypertext pages, more pronounced adaptation was significantly and positively related to performance even when learners' general processing depth was statistically controlled. Results were less consistent for variables capturing learners' self-monitoring, such as their judged task complexity. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Results indicated that self-reported cheating did not change in the year prior to the high school transition, but that reported cheating increased after the transition. Additional analyses indicated that across the high school transition, self-reported cheating in math increased for students who moved from high mastery to low mastery-oriented classes after the transition, and for students who moved from low performance to high performance-oriented classes; in contrast, self-reported cheating decreased for students who moved from low to high mastery-oriented math classrooms. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The present study had a semi-experimental design, included an experimental group (n=167) and a control one (n=206), and used pretest and posttest measures (self-regulated learning strategies' declarative knowledge, self-regulated learning macro-strategy planning-execution-assessment, self-regulated learning strategies on text, surface and deep learning approaches, and academic achievement). Data suggest that the students enrolled in the training program, comparing with students in the control group, showed a significant improvement in their declarative knowledge, general and on text use of learning strategies, increased their deep approach to learning, decreased their use of a surface approach and, in what concerns to academic achievement, statistically significant differences have been found in favour of the experimental group.},

Researchers have established that students have immature beliefs about the purpose of science, the nature of scientific knowledge, and the notion of scientific facts. Students who hold certain immature beliefs are less likely to acquire an integrated understanding of particular science concepts, and they are also less likely to change their conceptions once they are formed. Several implications of these findings from literature on conceptual change learning are drawn, and instructional strategies are proposed for promoting mature beliefs among secondary school students. The need for further research on the relation between epistemological beliefs and conceptual change learning is highlighted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

Nonetheless, when this effect is analyzed in detail there are inconsistent, and in some cases, contradictory results. The central aim of this study was to systematically investigate the effect of homework on performance of students in mathematics and science using multilevel models. The original sample consisted of 7,725 Spanish adolescents with a mean age of 13.78 ({$\pm$}0.82) of which 7,451 were evaluated after purging the sample of the students who did little to no homework. A 2-level hierarchical-linear analysis was performed, student and class, with 4 individual adjustment variables: gender, socioeconomic and cultural level, year repetition, and school grades, which were used to reflect previous student achievement. The individual level examined time spent, effort made, and the way homework was done. The class level considered frequency of assignment and quantity of homework. Prior knowledge, estimated using school grades, is shown to be the most important predictor of achievement in the study. Its effect is greater than the combined effect of all the other variables studied. Once background factors are controlled, the homework variables with most impact on the test are student autonomy and frequency of homework assignment by teachers. Autonomy when doing homework was shown to be the most important individual-level variable in both mathematics and science, and not effort and or time spent doing homework. The optimum duration of homework was found to be 1 hr a day. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

Representations were compared to written justification to gauge consistency and data were analyzed to identify relational patterns, with six stable patterns emerging from the conceptions (e.g., knowledge establishment and truth establishment). A content analysis was performed to: (a) identify the specific language frequently used to define these terms, and (b) contrast definitions as a whole to conceptions that populate the psychological and related literatures. The significance of the resulting patterns is considered in light of the literature in epistemic beliefs and empirical implications and practical relevance are discussed. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study used a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the impact of imputation method on the bias and efficiency of scale-level parameter estimates, including scale score means, between-scale correlations, and regression coefficients. Although the choice of imputation approach had no influence on the bias of scale-level parameter estimates, it had a substantial impact on efficiency, such that item-level imputation consistently produced a meaningful power advantage. The simulation results clearly supported the use of item-level imputation. To illustrate the differences between item- and scale-level imputation, we examined predictors of 7th-grade academic self-efficacy in a sample of 595 low-income Mexican Origin adolescents in a planned missingness design. The results of the empirical data analysis were consistent with those of the simulation and also suggested that researchers should be cautious when implementing planned missing data designs that necessitate scale-level imputation.},

The text included metaphors as examples of the various laws described. Results revealed that students profiled as metaphorical engaged in more metacognitive processing compared to students profiled as rational or empirical. Moreover, path analyses revealed that metacognitive monitoring positively predicted recall performance.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that sophisticated epistemological beliefs exert a positive influence on students' learning strategies and learning outcomes. This gives a clear educational relevance to studies on the development of methods for promoting a change in epistemological beliefs and making them more sophisticated. AIMS: To investigate the potential for influencing domain-specific epistemological beliefs through a short instructional intervention. SAMPLE: On the basis of their performance on a preliminary survey of epistemological beliefs, 58 students at a German university (87.7\% females) with a mean age of 21.86 years (SD=2.88) were selected. Half of them had more naive beliefs and the other half had more sophisticated ones. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one whose epistemological beliefs were challenged through refutational epistemological instruction or another receiving non-challenging informational instruction. The treatment effect was assessed by comparing pre- and post-instructional scores on two instruments tapping different layers of epistemological beliefs (DEBQ and CAEB). Data were subjected to factor analyses and analyses of variance. RESULTS: According to the CAEB, the naive group receiving the refutational epistemological instruction changed towards a more sophisticated view, whereas the sophisticated students receiving the informational instruction changed towards an unintended, more naive standpoint. According to the DEBQ, all research groups except the naive refutational group revealed changes towards a more naive view. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates the possibility of changing domain-specific epistemological beliefs through a short-term intervention. However, it questions the stability and elaborateness of domain-specific epistemological beliefs, particularly when domain knowledge is shallow.},

This popularity is, at least in part, because of the increased role of multilevel modeling techniques (e.g., hierarchical linear modeling and mul- tilevel structural equation modeling) in organizational research. IRR and IRA indices are often used to justify aggregating lower-level data used in composition models. The purpose of the current article is to expose researchers to the various issues surrounding the use of IRR and IRA indices often used in conjunction with multilevel models. To achieve this goal, the authors adopt a question-and-answer format and provide a tutorial in the appendices illustrat- ing how these indices may be computed using the SPSS software.},

  abstract = {In multilevel structural equation modeling, the ``standard'' approach to evaluating the goodness of model fit has a potential limitation in detecting the lack of fit at the higher level. Level-specific model fit evaluation can address this limitation and is more informative in locating the source of lack of model fit. We proposed level-specific test statistics for the test of overall model fit, comparative fit index, and root mean squared error of approximation using partially saturated models, and we also considered another level-specific approach proposed by Yuan and Bentler (2007). A simulation study showed that the standard approach failed to detect the lack of fit at the group level. The fit indexes produced by the level-specific approaches both successfully detected the lack of model fit at each level. There were only minor differences in the performance of the 2 level-specific approaches.},

  abstract = {\{\textbackslash{}dq\}The majority of data sets collected by researchers in all disciplines are multivariate, meaning that several measurements, observations, or recordings are taken on each of the units in the data set. These units might be human subjects, archaeological artifacts, countries, or a vast variety of other things. In a few cases, it may be sensible to isolate each variable and study it separately, but in most instances all the variables need to be examined simultaneously in order to fully grasp the structure and key features of the data. For this purpose, one or another method of multivariate analysis might be helpful, and it is with such methods that this book is largely concerned. Multivariate analysis includes methods both for describing and exploring such data and for making formal inferences about them. The aim of all the techniques is, in general sense, to display or extract the signal in the data in the presence of noise and to find out what the data show us in the midst of their apparent chaos. An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R explores the correct application of these methods so as to extract as much information as possible from the data at hand, particularly as some type of graphical representation, via the R software. Throughout the book, the authors give many examples of R code used to apply the multivariate techniques to multivariate data.\{\textbackslash{}dq\}--Publisher's description.},

Specifically, we manipulated the representation of physics concepts in texts about Newtonian mechanics and explored how these texts interacted with individuals' epistemic beliefs to facilitate or constrain learning. Results revealed that when individuals' epistemic beliefs were consistent with the knowledge representations in their assigned texts, they performed better on various measures of learning (use of processing strategies, text recall, and changes in misconceptions) than when their epistemic beliefs were inconsistent with the knowledge representations. These results have implications for how researchers conceptualize epistemic beliefs and support contemporary views regarding the context sensitivity of individuals' epistemic beliefs.

In contrast to the findings by W. F. Velicer and D. N. Jackson (see record 1990-27325-001) in this area, the present results suggest that there were systematic differences between POPPs defined by PCA and CFA and that these differences were present even when the correct number of dimensions was retained. Also, the POPPs defined by CFA may have been more generalizable than those defined by PCA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)},

Although PPK is thought to be an important aspect of teacher quality, it has seen little empirical investigation--largely because no direct and valid measure of PPK has previously been available. Study 1 describes the development of a 39-item measure using multiple-choice items, short-answer items, and video-based items to assess PPK. Experts rated the items to be relevant for teaching and domain general. Study 2 provides further evidence for the measure's validity. Data obtained from 746 German teacher candidates supported the hypothesized nomological network of PPK; the measure was sensitive to differences between groups; and variations in PPK did not overlap to any great extent with variations in discriminant constructs such as general reasoning abilities, personal beliefs, and domain-specific knowledge. Furthermore, PPK was positively associated with indicators of instructional quality from the students' perspective. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

To date, IOEDs have been identified only in mechanical and natural domains, occluding why they occur and suggesting that their implications are quite limited. Six studies illustrated that IOEDs occur because people adopt an inappropriately abstract construal style when they assess how well they understand concrete concepts. As this mechanism predicts, participants who naturally adopted concrete construal styles (Study 1) or were induced to adopt a concrete construal style (Studies 2-4 and 6), experienced diminished IOEDs. Two additional studies documented a novel IOED in the social psychological domain of electoral voting (Studies 5 and 6), demonstrating the generality of the construal mechanism, the authors also extended the presumed boundary conditions of the effect beyond mechanical and natural domains. These findings suggest a novel factor that might contribute to such diverse social-cognitive shortcomings as stereotyping, egocentrism, and the planning fallacy, where people adopt abstract representations of concepts that should be represented concretely.},

In the study, 120 undergraduate students in an educational technology course participated as part of their coursework. Using a wiki, triads reciprocally asked and responded to questions as constructing either a group summary or a group argument. Students with less advanced epistemological beliefs more actively coordinated formats and procedures for group work and achieved higher comprehension of reading materials in the collaborative summary than in the collaborative argumentation. By contrast, these differences were not found for students with more advanced epistemological beliefs. However, the interaction effect between tasks and epistemological beliefs disappeared for the quality of argumentation on case problems. Independently of epistemological beliefs, collaborative argumentation promoted more constructive and interactive peer questioning activities and helped to construct higher quality arguments in case problems than collaborative summary. Therefore, the effects of matching tasks and epistemological beliefs varied depending on types of learning outcomes (comprehension vs. argumentation) in online peer questioning. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The lack of a consensus about what constitutes significant GFI differences places limits on measurement invariance testing. We examine 20 GFIs based on the minimum fit function. A simulation under the two-group situation was used to examine changes in the GFIs ({$\increment$}GFIs) when invariance constraints were added. Based on the results, we recommend using {$\increment$}comparative fit index,{$\increment$}Gammahat, and{$\increment$}McDonald's Noncentrality Index to eval- uate measurement invariance. These three {$\increment$}GFIs are independent of both model complexity and sample size, and are not correlated with the overall fit measures.We propose critical values of these {$\increment$}GFIs that indicate measurement invariance.

The latter attended two different branches of high school, one following a scientific, and the other a technical-commercial curriculum. Their epistemological understanding was assessed in the five judgement domains included in the instrument developed by Kuhn, Cheney, and Weinstock (2000) [Kuhn, D., Cheney, R., \& Weinstock, M.

Data show that more than 70\% of identified patterns were consistent and interpretable within the underlying theoretical framework. Absolutist positions were more frequent in judgments about values even when the shift to non-absolutism was attained in all other domains. Gender, grade level, and curriculum significantly differentiated participants for the first developmental transition, from absolutism to multiplism.

  abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a frequently used multivariate analysis technique in statistics. Jennrich and Sampson (1966) solved a significant EFA factor loading matrix rotation problem by deriving the direct Quartimin rotation. Jennrich was also the first to develop standard errors for rotated solutions, although these have still not made their way into most statistical software programs. This is perhaps because Jennrich's achievements were partly overshadowed by the subsequent development of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) by J{\"o}reskog (1969). The strict requirement of zero cross-loadings in CFA, however, often does not fit the data well and has led to a tendency to rely on extensive model modification to find a well-fitting model. In such cases, searching for a well-fitting measurement model may be better carried out by EFA (Browne, 2001). Furthermore, misspecification of zero loadings usually leads to distorted factors with over-estimated factor correlations and subsequent distorted structural relations. This article describes an EFA-SEM (ESEM) approach, where in addition to or instead of a CFA measurement model, an EFA measurement model with rotations can be used in a structural equation model. The ESEM approach has recently been implemented in the Mplus program. ESEM gives access to all the usual SEM parameters and the loading rotation gives a transformation of structural coefficients as well. Standard errors and overall tests of model fit are obtained. Geomin and Target rotations are discussed. Examples of ESEM models include multiple-group EFA with measurement and structural invariance testing, test\textendash{}retest (longitudinal) EFA, EFA with covariates and direct effects, and EFA with correlated residuals. Testing strategies with sequences of EFA and CFA models are discussed. Simulated and real data are used to illustrate the points.},

Three basic dimensions of teaching quality have previously been described: classroom management, cognitive activation, and supportive climate. However, student ratings, especially those provided by primary school students, have been criticised for being biased by factors such as teacher popularity. The present study examines ratings of teaching quality and science learning among third graders. Results of multilevel confirmatory factor analyses (N=1556 students, 89 classes) indicate that the three-dimensional model of teaching quality can be replicated in ratings of third graders. In a longitudinal study (N=1070 students, 54 classes), we found ratings of classroom management to predict student achievement, and ratings of cognitive activation and supportive climate to predict students' development of subject-related interest after teacher popularity is controlled for. The analyses show that student ratings can be useful measures of teaching quality in primary school. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Observer ratings are often used to measure instructional quality. They are, however, usually based on observations gathered over short periods of time. Few studies have attempted to determine whether these periods are sufficient to provide reliable measures of instructional quality. Using generalizability theory, this study investigates (a) how three dimensions of instructional quality - classroom management, personal learning support, and cognitive activation of students - vary between the lessons of a specific teacher, and (b) how many lessons per teacher are necessary to establish sufficiently reliable measures of these dimensions. Analyses are based on ratings of five lessons for 38 teachers. Classroom management and personal learning support were stable across lessons, whereas cognitive activation showed high variability. Consequently, one lesson per teacher suffices to measure classroom management and personal learning support, whereas nine lessons would be needed for cognitive activation. The importance of advancing our theoretical understanding of cognitive activation is discussed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

When making direct-likelihood or Bayesian inferences about \texttheta, it is appropriate to ignore the process that causes missing data if the missing data are missing at random and the parameter of the missing data process is `distinct' from \texttheta.

  abstract = {Research on epistemological beliefs has clearly increased in the last decade. Even though the construct is clearer and relevant data are being collected, there are important theoretical and methodological issues that need further clarification. One of them is the debate about the domain generality-specificity of epistemological beliefs. I argue that there are both theoretical and methodological difficulties that hinder a more fruitful approach of the domain generality-specificity debate. Differences in goals and scope of the diverse conceptualizations about epistemological beliefs and how they devise the role of content-domain and context are a major source of difficulties. Methodological problems such as whether such epistemological beliefs can be measured "in isolation"-free of content and context influence-or the impossibility of collecting direct measures of epistemological beliefs may influence how the domain generality-specificity question is approached. Some suggestions about how these difficulties may be overcome are developed. The relevance of exploring epistemological beliefs across domains and across contexts is emphasized. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In addition, we examined whether activating epistemic beliefs is related to individual characteristics, such as prior knowledge of the topic and argumentative reasoning skill; also whether learning from the Web is influenced by epistemic beliefs in action and the ability to detect fallacies in arguments. The participants (N = 64) were students of Grade 13, who were asked to think aloud during navigation. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. Findings reveal that most participants spontaneously activated beliefs about all four dimensions identified in the literature, that is, about the simplicity/complexity, certainty/uncertainty, justification, and source of knowledge, at different levels of sophistication. Most epistemic reflections were about the source of knowledge. Two patterns of contextualized epistemic beliefs emerged and significantly influenced learning from the Web, which was also affected by participants' ability to identify argumentative fallacies.

The Special Issue starts with a theoretical paper. It is then followed by four empirical studies which deal with one or more of these questions. From all contributions it emerges that epistemic beliefs are situated within a metacognitive architecture of our mind. Moreover, all the empirical papers examine epistemic beliefs in relation to other constructs that include metacognitive aspects, mainly self-regulation in learning.

  volume = {44},
  issn = {0027-3171},
  abstract = {This article is a methodological-substantive synergy. Methodologically, we demonstrate latent-variable contextual models that integrate structural equation models (with multiple indicators) and multilevel models. These models simultaneously control for and unconfound measurement error due to sampling of items at the individual (L1) and group (L2) levels and sampling error due the sampling of persons in the aggregation of L1 characteristics to form L2 constructs. We consider a set of models that are latent or manifest in relation to sampling items (measurement error) and sampling of persons (sampling error) and discuss when different models might be most useful. We demonstrate the flexibility of these 4 core models by extending them to include random slopes, latent (single-level or cross-level) interactions, and latent quadratic effects. Substantively we use these models to test the big-fish-little-pond effect (BFLPE), showing that individual student levels of academic self-concept (L1-ASC) are positively associated with individual level achievement (L1-ACH) and negatively associated with school-average achievement (L2-ACH)\textemdash{}a finding with important policy implications for the way schools are structured. Extending tests of the BFLPE in new directions, we show that the nonlinear effects of the L1-ACH (a latent quadratic effect) and the interaction between gender and L1-ACH (an L1 \texttimes{} L1 latent interaction) are not significant. Although random-slope models show no significant school-to-school variation in relations between L1-ACH and L1-ASC, the negative effects of L2-ACH (the BFLPE) do vary somewhat with individual L1-ACH. We conclude with implications for diverse applications of the set of latent contextual models, including recommendations about their implementation, effect size estimates (and confidence intervals) appropriate to multilevel models, and directions for further research in contextual effect analysis.},

Results support the idea that individuals' epistemological beliefs tend to be domain independent. Mathematical epistemological factors correlated with the corresponding social science epistemological factors.

Latent class transition analyses were conducted to determine the stability and change of latent class membership across two time points. For both baseline and follow-up measures, latent class analyses suggested that two latent classes were most appropriate for characterizing the youths using the four domains of risk factors. One class reflected youths reporting few problems in any risk area; the second class reflected youths reporting problems in many of the risk domains. The latent class transition analyses indicated that about two thirds of the youths experienced similar problems over time. The results emphasize the heterogeneity of this study's sample.

With a focus on the hands-on end-to-end process for data mining, Williams guides the reader through various capabilities of the easy to use, free, and open source Rattle Data Mining Software built on the sophisticated R Statistical Software. The focus on doing data mining rather than just reading about data mining is refreshing.The book covers data understanding, data preparation, data refinement, model building, model evaluation, and practical deployment. The reader will learn to rapidly deliver a data mining project using software easily installed for free from the Internet. Coupling Rattle with R delivers a very sophisticated data mining environment with all the power, and more, of the many commercial offerings.},

  volume = {105},
  issn = {00071269},
  abstract = {Coefficient alpha is the most popular measure of reliability (and certainly of internal consistency reliability) reported in psychological research. This is noteworthy given the numerous deficiencies of coefficient alpha documented in the psychometric literature. This mismatch between theory and practice appears to arise partly because users of psychological scales are unfamiliar with the psychometric literature on coefficient alpha and partly because alternatives to alpha are not widely known. We present a brief review of the psychometric literature on coefficient alpha, followed by a practical alternative in the form of coefficient omega. To facilitate the shift from alpha to omega, we also present a brief guide to the calculation of point and interval estimates of omega using a free, open source software environment.},

  abstract = {This study explored the domain specificity of students' beliefs about academic knowledge in three related studies. Using a four-factor model as an initial framework, a series of domain-specific items about mathematics and history was developed. In Study I, these items were administered to 182 undergraduates, and the psychometric properties and underlying factor structure were examined via exploratory factor analysis. In Study II, the modified instrument, the Domain-Specific Beliefs Questionnaire (DSBQ), was administered to 633 students and a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted. A subsample of participants' responses on the DSBQ was also compared to responses on Schommer's epistemological questionnaire. Study III involved a second confirmatory factor analysis using data from a new sample (n = 523). Those data were examined for potential gender differences. Overall, the results of this investigation suggested that students possess certain domain-specific beliefs about knowledge in mathematics and history. Further, a significant moderate relationship between the DSBQ and Schommer's questionnaire provided some evidence of domain-generality in undergraduates' epistemological beliefs.},

  abstract = {This study used think-aloud methodology to investigate 51 Norwegian undergraduates' topic-specific epistemic cognition while working with six documents presenting conflicting views on the issue of cell phones and potential health risks. Results showed that students' epistemic cognition was represented by one dimension concerning the certainty and simplicity of knowledge and three dimensions concerning the justification for knowing by different sources. Moreover, components of a mechanism of change, in particular epistemic doubt and resolution strategies, were identified in the think-aloud protocols. Finally, these mechanism of change components seemed to operate within distinct dimensions of epistemic cognition. Three case studies were used to elaborate on and illustrate how epistemic cognition may be differently involved in the reading of multiple conflicting documents over the course of reading. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In Experiment 1, children's initial conceptual knowledge predicted gains in procedural knowledge, and gains in procedural knowledge predicted improvements in conceptual knowledge. Correct problem representations mediated the relation between initial conceptual knowledge and improved procedural knowledge. In Experiment 2, amount of support for correct problem representation was experimentally manipulated, and the manipulations led to gains in procedural knowledge. Thus, conceptual and procedural knowledge develop iteratively, and improved problem representation is I mechanism in this process.},

Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psychological needs--competence, autonomy, and relatedness--which when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished motivation and well-being. Also considered is the significance of these psychological needs and processes within domains such as health care, education, work, sport, religion, and psychotherapy.},

  abstract = {The Occupational Stress and Coping Inventory (AVEM; Schaarschmidt \{\&\} Fischer, 1996, 1997) is a diagnostic instrument comprising 11 subscales designed to measure personal and social resources used to cope with occupational demands. Cluster analyses of teacher data identified four types (the healthy-ambitious type; the unambitious type; risk type A: the excessively-ambitious type; risk type B: the resigned type), who are assumed to differ in terms of both the occupational stress they experience and instructional behavior. Previous research seeking to validate this typology has drawn on teachers' self-report data. The present article examines the extent to which the stress experienced by mathematics teachers is reflected in students' reports of these teachers' instructional behavior. Data were obtained from a sample of 314 ninth-grade classes and their mathematics teachers in the context of the German national extension to the PISA 2003 study. The results indicate, first, that the Schaarschmidt \{\&\} Fischer typology can be replicated in the present sample. Second, on four of the six dimensions of instructional quality examined, significant differences were found between the four types, indicating that students perceive the instruction provided by teachers under stress to be of lower quality.

The measuring instruments differ considerably on what dimensions they measure and researchers are urged to select carefully the one that best matches their purpose. Specific descriptive information is provided regarding selected in- struments to aid researchers in their choices.

Study 1 involved the development of a Greek Epistemological Beliefs Evaluation Instrument for Physics (GEBEP) which was administered to 394 students (10th graders). Study 2 investigated the hypothesis that physics epistemological sophistication as measured by the GEBEP is a good predictor of physics understanding. The participants were selected from the 394 students who participated in Study 1. More specifically we selected the 10\% (38) students with the highest scores in the GEBEP (high epistemological sophistication group, HES) and the 10\% (38) students with the lowest GEBEP scores (low epistemological sophistication group, LES) and measured their understanding of Newton's three laws using the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation instrument (FMCE) developed by Thornton and Sokoloff (1998). The results showed that the HES group had significantly higher scores in the FMCE than the LES group. Regression analysis showed that beliefs regarding the Construction and Stability of physics knowledge and the Structure of physics knowledge were good predictors of physics understanding. Study 3 re-examined the same hypothesis on a new independent sample of students. The results based on the entire sample, showed again that beliefs regarding the Construction and Stability of physics knowledge predicted physics understanding. Overall, the results suggest that sophisticated physics-related epistemological beliefs are necessary but not sufficient for physics understanding and point to the importance of taking them into consideration in physics education.},

  abstract = {Epistemological beliefs about the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge are often assumed to be similar across different domains of knowledge. This assumption was tested by comparing beliefs about scientific research on psychological and biological development. Undergraduates from the United States and the United Kingdom responded to a set of epistemologically relevant statements about each field and then compared the two fields directly in terms of their confidence in the conclusions and advice of experts. On all measures, more negative beliefs were expressed about research on psychological development. Although U.S. students were more skeptical about both fields, U.S. and U.K. students displayed similar response patterns. To justify their skepticism toward scientific research as a valid source of knowledge about psychological development, students in both countries gave similar reasons (e.g., the difficulty in accurately measuring psychological variables). These results demonstrate that epistemological beliefs can differ substantially between two closely related fields. They also highlight issues that must be addressed to make education about the validity of research in developmental psychology more effective. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Individual raters vary the severity of their ratings in a manner dependent upon a wide array of factors. Most efforts intended to secure reliable and valid ratings across judges assume that the goal is to obtain identical ratings from different judges for the same performance. In contrast to these approaches, probabilistic conjoint measurement facilitates observation and calibration of differences in judge severity, making it possible to account for these differences in the interpretation of the assigned ratings. This chapter addresses issues in the application of Facets analyses to writing assessment, aesthetic judgment, and the evaluation of public speaking ability.},

This certainly seems like an appropriate time for looking backward and looking forward in assessment. Furthermore, a new edition of the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA, APA, \& NCME, 1999) has been published, and the previous editions of the Standards have served as benchmarks in the development of measurement theory. This backward glance will be just that, a glance. After a brief historical review focusing mainly on construct validity, the current state of validity theory will be summarized, with an emphasis on the role of arguments in validation. Then how an argument-based approach might be applied will be examined in regards to two issues in validity theory: the distinction between performance-based and theory-based interpretations, and the role of consequences in validation.},

Validity is associated with the interpretation assigned to test scores rather than with the test scores or the test.

The interpretive arguments associated with most test-score interpretations involve multiple inferences and assumptions. An explicit recognition of the inferences and assumptions in the interpretive argument makes it possible to identify the kinds of evidence needed to evaluate the argument. Evidence for the inferences and assumptions in the argument supports the interpretation, and evidence against any part of the argument casts doubt on the interpretation.

  abstract = {The traditional conception of validity divides it into three separate and substitutable types: content, criterion, and construct validities. This view is fragmented and incomplete, especially because it fails to take into account both evidence of the value implications of score meaning as a basis for action and the social consequences of score use. The new unified concept of validity interrelates these issues as fundamental aspects of a more comprehensive theory of construct validity that addresses both score meaning and social values in test interpretation and test use. That is, unified validity integrates considerations of content, criteria, and consequences into a construct framework for the empirical testing of rational hypotheses about score meaning and theoretically relevant relationships, including those of an applied and a scientific nature. Six distinguishable aspects of construct validity are highlighted as a means of addressing central issues implicit in the notion of validity as a unified concept. These are content, substantive, structural, generalizability, external, and consequential aspects of construct validity. In effect, these six aspects function as general validity criteria or standards for all educational and psychological measurement, including performance assessments, which are discussed in some detail because of their increasing emphasis in educational and employment settings.

  volume = {50},
  issn = {00220655},
  abstract = {To validate an interpretation or use of test scores is to evaluate the plausibility of the claims based on the scores. An argument-based approach to validation suggests that the claims based on the test scores be outlined as an argument that specifies the inferences and supporting assumptions needed to get from test responses to score- based interpretations and uses. Validation then can be thought of as an evaluation of the coherence and completeness of this interpretation/use argument and of the plau- sibility of its inferences and assumptions. In outlining the argument-based approach to validation, this paper makes eight general points. First, it is the proposed score interpretations and uses that are validated and not the test or the test scores. Second, the validity of a proposed interpretation or use depends on how well the evidence supports the claims being made. Third,more-ambitious claims require more support than less-ambitious claims. Fourth, more-ambitious claims (e.g., construct interpre- tations) tend to be more useful than less-ambitious claims, but they are also harder to validate. Fifth, interpretations and uses can change over time in response to new needs and new understandings leading to changes in the evidence needed for valida- tion. Sixth, the evaluation of score uses requires an evaluation of the consequences of the proposed uses; negative consequences can render a score use unacceptable. Seventh, the rejection of a score use does not necessarily invalidate a prior, underly- ing score interpretation. Eighth, the validation of the score interpretation on which a score use is based does not validate the score use.},

Should job applicants be assessed on fine-grained personality variables or on broader personality variables, such as the Big Five dimensions of personality? Most human resources practitioners and researchers appear to assume that more specific and narrow measures of personality traits result in better and more fine-grained understanding of the person, and therefore ought to be preferred over global measures. We review evidence that when the criterion of interest is job performance, broader personality measures may be preferable over narrowly focused ones. It appears that the alleged advantages of narrowly defined traits and narrowly constructed measures are mainly due to erroneous conventional beliefs predicated upon statistical artifacts. In personnel selection research and practice, we advocate the use of broader personality traits for both better prediction and explanation.},

Although the reliability and validity of student perceptions of teaching are regularly confirmed, the student perspective in the evaluation of teaching is still viewed with scepticism. This study examines the effects of student feedback. For this purpose, 305 teachers who are users of a web-based student feedback system that is available in the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (Germany) were surveyed using a self-designed questionnaire. Using multiple regressions, self-reported changes in teaching can be predicted from existing levels of motivation and the constructiveness of the discussion between students and the classroom teacher. Externally motivated student feedback appears to lead to changes in the classroom as well. The results argue for the integration of student feedback into a school-wide quality management system. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Perry (1968). Comprehension criteria reported by dualists more often involved the knowledge category found in the B. S. Bloom et al (1956) book, Taxonomy, and those reported by relativists, the comprehension or application categories. The nature and number of reported comprehension criteria were found to be predictive of course grades. Ss reporting the use of comprehension or application criteria earned better grades than those reporting the use of knowledge criteria; Ss reporting the use of more than one criterion earned better grades than those reporting the use of a single criterion. These data suggest that one's epistemological beliefs may dictate one's choice of comprehension standards and that these epistemological standards, in turn, may control the effectiveness of one's text processing efforts.

  title = {The Pragmatics of Connotation},
  volume = {39},
  issn = {03782166},
  abstract = {The connotations of a language expression are pragmatic effects that arise from encyclopaedic knowledge about its denotation (or reference) and also from experiences, beliefs, and prejudices about the contexts in which the expression is typically used. The connotation of a language expression is clearly distinct from its sense, denotation and reference. For example, Mike and Michael can have the same reference but different connotations. John is an unsuitable name for your new-born daughter; so is Springtime in Paris an inappropriate name for a 1200cc Harley-Davidson motorbike or an auto-repair shop. Identifying the connotations of a term is to identify the community attitude towards it. For instance the connotations of English octopus and the Japanese translation equivalent tako are very different: an octopus is a sinister, alien creature; tako is edible and endearing. Connotation is intimately involved with notions of appropriateness in language use; i.e. with pragmatic effect. For instance, racist dysphemisms occur when a speaker refers to or implicates the hearer or some third person's race, ethnicity, or nationality in such terms as to cause a face affront. Many such 'racist' terms can be disarmed by being used, without irony, as in-group solidarity markers by the targeted group; e.g. the use of nigger/nigga among African Americans. The negative connotations of some existing word often lead to its replacement. Although Jesus Christ! is blasphemous; Gee whiz and By jingo are not. From a purely rational viewpoint, if one of these is blasphemous, then all of them are. But the pragmatic effects, i.e. connotations are different. Connotation is a thoroughly pragmatic category of meaning. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {To improve the quality of teaching, educational accountability needs to include periodic external evaluations of students' performance. This requires evaluation formats which support the development of the educational process and provide information which is understandable for teachers. The aims of this study were to review: (i) how teachers understand the feedback they receive from external evaluations; (ii) how they use the feedback; and (iii) how teachers' understanding and use of such feedback affects the achievement of their students. None of the papers included contained simultaneous a study with all three of these aspects of external evaluations; the review shows that teachers have many problems understanding feedback and mainly focus their use of it on developing strategic teaching tactics. Research that focuses on teachers' understanding of external evaluation, their use of it, and how the use of the feedback can foster student achievement is needed.},

  abstract = {Computer-assisted formative assessments with multiple-tier items are a valid instrument for diagnosing students' conceptual understanding in learning domains with well-structured declarative knowledge (e.g. science education). However, it is unknown how feedback on multiple-tier items can improve learning success. Therefore, we assessed (1) predictors of students' perception and use of elaborated feedback, and (2) if feedback content (elaborated, verification, control) matters in explaining students' achievement in post- and retention tests. We developed computer-assisted formative tests for a teaching unit on evolutionary adaptations. Three treatment groups were employed with varying feedback content: Treatment 1 (T1) was an elaborated instruction-based feedback, T2 was a dichotomous verification feedback, and T3 (control) consisted of reading appropriate texts (no formative assessment and no feedback). Afterwards, T1 was separated into one subgroup with pupils who used the feedback thoroughly (T1A) and a subgroup that did not use the feedback (T1B). Ten secondary classrooms were used and 261 pupils participated in this study. Each student in each classroom was randomly assigned to one treatment group. Correlation and univariate regression analysis showed that perception and use of elaborated feedback were related to intrinsic motivation and self-reported grades. Multivariate analysis of covariance was applied to check treatment effects on post-tests and retention tests as dependent variables. Results revealed that verification feedback (T2) and elaborated feedback when students did use it (T1A) was superior to no feedback (T3) and elaborated feedback when students did not use it (T1B). Implications for the design of multiple-tier diagnostic assessments are discussed.},

  title = {Epistemic Styles and Mathematics Problem Solving: {{Examining}} Relations in the Context of Self-Regulated Learning},
  abstract = {This dissertation examines relations between personal epistemology and facets of self-regulated learning, moves away from correlational designs, and adopts a more process-oriented methodology. For this study, a philosophical conceptualization of epistemology was integrated with conceptualizations from educational psychology and mathematics education. The primary purpose of this study was to examine relations between approaches to knowing, mathematics problem solving, and regulation of cognition. A secondary purpose was to examine whether mathematics students become more rational in their approaches to knowing and whether their epistemic beliefs change through higher levels of education. One hundred twenty-seven students were sampled from undergraduate university mathematics and statistics courses. Students completed self-report measures to reflect epistemic styles, epistemic beliefs, and dispositions regarding elements of self-regulated learning. Students were profiled as predominantly rational, predominantly empirical, or both rational and empirical in their approaches to knowing. Seventeen students were chosen to participate in two problem-solving sessions. Problem-solving episodes were coded for evidence of planning, monitoring, control, use of empirical and rational argumentation, and justification for solutions. Differences in self-reported metacognitive self-regulation were found between students profiled as high on rationalism and empiricism and students profiled as predominantly empirical. No other self-reported differences were found. When problem solving, students profiled as predominantly rational had the highest frequency of planning, monitoring, and control. These differences were attributed to patterns identified in students' self-efficacy. No differences in rationalism scores were found between lower- and upper-year university students but differences were found in their beliefs about the structure of knowledge and the source of knowledge. Differences were also found in the quality of rational arguments between lower- and upper-year university students when solving problems. Students profiled as predominantly rational in their approaches to knowing were predominantly rational in their approaches to problems solving. Similarly, students profiled as predominantly empirical in their approaches to knowing were predominantly empirical in their approaches to problem solving. Finally, students profiled as both rational and empirical in their approaches to knowing were predominantly rational in their approaches to problem solving. Results are discussed in the context of various theoretical frameworks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)},

So much so that there has been speculation as to whether human behavior can be truly characterized as normatively rational (see, e.g., Stanovich, 1999, 2009 ).

Specifically, we make a case that a central challenge in developing students' reasoning is developing their epistemic cognition. Next, we discuss the promotion of both conceptual knowledge and conceptual change in science. We conclude with an overview of pedagogical approaches that can support the development of epistemic cognition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

At the start of first grade, we administered measures of numerical processing (digit naming, symbolic numerical magnitude comparison, nonsymbolic numerical magnitude comparison) as well as measures of intellectual ability, preschool mathematical abilities, working memory and processing speed. Our longitudinal data indicate that children's numerical processing skills at primary school entrance were predictively related to their future competence in single-digit arithmetic and their reliance on arithmetic fact retrieval. This association was not explained by children's intellectual ability, preschool mathematical abilities, verbal working memory, visual-spatial short-term memory and processing speed. These findings indicate that numerical processing skills precede children's development in single-digit arithmetic.},

  title = {A General Approach to Causal Mediation Analysis.},
  volume = {15},
  abstract = {Traditionally in the social sciences, causal mediation analysis has been formulated, understood, and implemented within the framework of linear structural equation models. We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.

This framework simultaneously considers individual differences in cognitive abilities, self-regulatory processes of motivation, and IPR demands. Evidence for the framework is provided in the context of skill acquisition, in which IPR and ability demands change as a function of practice, training paradigm, and timing of goal setting (GS). Three field-based lab experiments were conducted with 1,010 US Air Force trainees. Exp 1 evaluated the basic ability\textendash{}performance parameters of the air traffic controller task and GS effects early in practice. Exp 2 evaluated GS later in practice. Exp 3 investigated the simultaneous effects of training content, GS and ability\textendash{}performance interactions. Results support the theoretical framework and have implications for notions of ability\textendash{}motivation interactions and design of training and motivation programs.

We then go beyond this largely pedagogical function and delineate the conceptual and strategic implications of making use of such distinctions with regard to a wide range of phenomena, including control and stress, attitudes, and personality traits. We also provide a specific compendium of analytic procedures appropriate for making the most effective use of the moderator and mediator distinction, both separately and in terms of a broader causal system that includes both moderators and mediators.

The questionnaire responses gathered from 377 high school students in Taiwan were utilized to elicit such relationships. The analysis of the structural equation model revealed that students' absolutist scientific epistemic beliefs led to lower-level conceptions of learning science (i.e. learning science as memorizing, preparing for tests, calculating, and practicing) while sophisticated scientific epistemic beliefs might trigger higher-level conceptions of learning science (i.e. learning science as increase of knowledge, applying, and attaining understanding). The students' lower-level conceptions of learning science were also found to negatively associate with their self-efficacy of learning science, while the higher-level conceptions of learning science fostered students' self-efficacy. However, this study found that students who viewed scientific knowledge as uncertain (advanced epistemic belief) tended to possess lower self-efficacy toward learning science.},

  abstract = {Background: There is burgeoning research within educational psychology on both epistemic cognition and multiple--documents literacy, as well as on relationships between the two constructs. Aim: To examine relationships between epistemic cognition concerning the justification of knowledge claims and sourcing and argumentation skills. Sample: Participants were 51 Norwegian undergraduates. Method: Three dimensions of justification were identified in think--aloud protocols based on students' reading of six documents presenting conflicting claims on the controversial scientific issue of cell phone radiation and health risks: justification by authority, personal justification and justification by multiple sources. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the unique predictability of these dimensions for essay performance after removing variance associated with prior knowledge about the topic of the documents. Results: After controlling for topic knowledge, justification by multiple sources uniquely predicted students' sourcing and argumentation in essays that they wrote after reading the documents, with students trying to justify knowledge claims by corroborating across several sources of information more likely to include explicit source citations, link sources and contents, and display better, more integrated argumentation in their essays. Conclusion: Findings are considered in the light of a theoretical framework for multiple--documents literacy adapted to the domain of science, and both theoretical and educational implications are discussed.

  abstract = {The current study explored high school student cheating in communities of advantage, gathering survey data from 4,316 high school students in upper middle class communities and qualitative data from a smaller group of students, school leaders, teachers, and parents. Results indicated pervasive cheating among students (93\{\%\} reported cheating at least once and 26\{\%\} of upperclassmen indicated cheating in 7 or more of 13 ways listed on the survey). Students described schools as lacking clarity or consequences regarding cheating and expressed feeling forced to cheat in a school culture that promotes getting ahead over learning. The discussion focuses on why advantaged contexts are ripe for student cheating and proposes strategies for change. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

The Maslach Burnout Inventory, Rotter's Internal--External Locus of Control Scale, and a pupil control ideology form were administered to 191 elementary school teachers. Ss who rated themselves as being more burned out were more likely to have an external LOC and a custodial orientation toward the control of pupils. External, custodial Ss were found more often to experience depersonalized feelings and to frequently and intensely experience a lack of personal accomplishment. Results indicate that teacher burnout is related to LOC and pupil ideology, and those teachers would be more likely to choose teaching again than their non-burned out counterparts.

  abstract = {The term epistemological beliefs (EBs) refers to the nature of students' beliefs of knowledge and learning, these are related to the learning process through their effect on academic performance, motivation and self-regulation. Schommer has argued that the concept is multidimensional and consists of four distinct dimensions, the structure of knowledge, the stability of knowledge, the ability of learning and the speed of learning. The aim of the present study is to explore the structure of epistemic beliefs in a Greek sample, according to the theoretical model of Schommer, and how these beliefs are related to academic performance and other demographic and non demographic variables. The sample was composed by 470 students attending the three grades of upper high school. The students responded to the Epistemological Belief Questionnaire (Schommer, 2000). The results showed that the structure of the epistemological beliefs is in accordance to Schommer's theoretical model as regards the four dimensions and that the dimension structure of knowledge was the strongest factor. Low reliability rates lead to doubts regarding Schommer's conceptual model. Moreover, it was found that ability of learning and stability of knowledge significantly contribute to the prediction of academic performance and that higher grades are related to sophisticated EBs. It was also found that girls have more sophisticated EBs than boys in the speed of learning, and that older students have more sophisticated EBs in the stability of knowledge. Similar findings were found for the students of the theoretical study direction in terms of the stability and the structure of knowledge.

  abstract = {\{\textbackslash{}dq\}Preface This book has its genesis in my PhD research at the London School of Economics. I started the degree with questions about the 2008/09 financial crisis and planned to spend most of my time researching about capital adequacy requirements. But I quickly realized much of my time would actually be spent learning the day-to-day tasks of data gathering, analysis, and results presentation. After plodding through for awhile, the breaking point came while reentering results into a regression table after I had tweaked one of my statistical models, yet again. Surely there was a better way to do research that would allow me to spend more time answering my research questions. Making research reproducible for others also means making it better organized and efficient for yourself. So, my search for a better way led me straight to the tools for reproducible computational research. The reproducible research community is very active, knowledgeable and helpful. Nonetheless, I often encountered holes in this collective knowledge, or at least had no resource to bring it all together as a whole. That is my intention for this book: to bring together the skills I have picked up for actually doing and presenting computational research. Hopefully, the book along with making reproducible research more common, will save researchers hours of Googling, so they can spend more time addressing their research questions. I would not have been able to write this book without many people's advice and support. Foremost is John Kimmel, acquisitions editor at Chapman \{\&\} Hall. He approached me with in Spring 2012 with the general idea and opportunity for this book\{\textbackslash{}dq\}--},

  title = {A General and Simple Method for Obtaining {{R2}} from Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models},
  volume = {4},
  issn = {2041210X},
  abstract = {* The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. * The presentation of `variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. * One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). * Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. * This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

A stratified random sampling technique was used to assess the epistemological beliefs of 386 students at three universities in central Illinois. Confirming previous research, the results suggest that epistemological beliefs can be represented in terms of five factors: (a) certainty of knowledge, (b) omniscient authority, (c) orderly process, (d) innate ability, and (e) quick learning. Students who study in the "soft" fields (i.e., social science and arts/ humanities) have a stronger tendency to believe that knowledge is uncertain, are more reliant on their independent reasoning ability, and have a stronger feeling that learning is not an orderly process than students in "hard" fields (i.e., engineering and business). Graduate students showed a stronger tendency than undergraduate students to believe that knowledge is often uncertain, that learning is not usually an orderly process, and that knowledge is best acquired from independent reasoning. The results of this study suggest that students' beliefs about learning are a product of the activity, the culture, and the context in which they are cultivated.},

The paper then reviews the role of latent variables in multiple regression, probit and logistic regression, factor analysis, latent curve models, item response theory, latent class analysis, and structural equation models. Though these application areas are diverse, the paper highlights the similarities as well as the differences in the manner in which the latent variables are defined and used.

  isbn = {978-1-4614-7137-0},
  abstract = {Statistical learning refers to a set of tools for modeling and understanding complex datasets. It is a recently developed area in statistics and blends with parallel developments in computer science and, in particular, machine learning. The field encompasses many methods such as the lasso and sparse regression, classification and regression trees, and boosting and support vector machines. With the explosion of ``Big Data'' problems, statistical learning has be- come a very hot field in many scientific areas as well as marketing, finance, and other business disciplines. People with statistical learning skills are in high demand. One of the first books in this area\textemdash{}The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL) (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman)\textemdash{}was published in 2001, with a second edition in 2009. ESL has become a popular text not only in statis- tics but also in related fields. One of the reasons for ESL's popularity is its relatively accessible style. But ESL is intended for individuals with ad- vanced training in the mathematical sciences. An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) arose from the perceived need for a broader and less tech- nical treatment of these topics. In this new book, we cover many of the same topics as ESL, but we concentrate more on the applications of the methods and less on the mathematical details. We have created labs illus- trating how to implement each of the statistical learning methods using the popular statistical software package R. These labs provide the reader with valuable hands-on experience. This book is appropriate for advanced undergraduates or master's stu- dents in statistics or related quantitative fields or for individuals in other disciplines who wish to use statistical learning tools to analyze their data. It can be used as a textbook for a course spanning one or two semesters. We would like to thank several readers for valuable comments on prelim- inary drafts of this book: Pallavi Basu, Alexandra Chouldechova, Patrick Danaher, Will Fithian, Luella Fu, Sam Gross, Max Grazier G'Sell, Court- ney Paulson, Xinghao Qiao, Elisa Sheng, Noah Simon, Kean Ming Tan, and Xin Lu Tan.},

  abstract = {Experts in cognitive domains differ from non-experts in how they represent problems and knowledge, and in their epistemic understandings of tasks in their domain of expertise. This study investigates whether task-specific epistemic understanding also underlies the representation of knowledge on an everyday reasoning task on which the competent reasoners have neither expert domain knowledge nor training. 180 people on jury duty were assessed for epistemological understanding about the nature of knowledge and knowing in general, understanding of the specific task of the juror, and level of argument skill and evidence representation on two jury cases. Epistemic construal of the juror task and task-specific competent reasoning was found related to general epistemology, argument skills, and representation of the evidence. Additionally, estimations of the possibility of certainty in general and in a juror task predicted the participants' expressed certainty about their verdict choices. Implications for developing everyday reasoning competence are discussed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  issn = {00811750},
  abstract = {Data in social and behavioral sciences are often hierarchically organized. Multilevel statistical procedures have been developed to analyze such data while taking into account the dependence of observations. When simultaneously evaluating models at all levels, a significant statistic provides no information on the level at which the model is misspecified. Model misspecification can exist at one or several levels simultaneously. When one level is misspecified, the other levels may be affected even when they are correctly specified. Motivated by these observations, we propose to separate a multilevel covariance structure into multiple single-level covariance structure models and to fit these single-level models as in conventional covariance structure analysis. A procedure for segregating the multilevel model into single-level models is developed. Five test statistics for evaluating a model at each level are provided. Standard error formulas for the separate estimators are also provided, and their efficiency is compared to simultaneous estimators. Empirical and Monte Carlo results demonstrate the advantages of the segregated procedure over the simultaneous procedure. Computer programs that will allow the developed procedure to be used in practice are also presented.},

This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range ofmodels under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

The present volume aims to integrate existing methodological developments within a consistent terminology and notation, provide examples and explain a number of new developments, especially in the areas of discrete response data, time series models, random cross classifications, errors of measurement, missing data and nonlinear models. In many cases these developments are the subject of continuing research, so that we can expect further elaborations of the procedures described.The main text seeks to avoid undue statistical complexity, with methodological derivations occurring in appendices. Examples and diagrams are used to illustrate the application of the techniques and references given to other work.

Statistical analyses of the data using a Repeated Measures ANOVA showed a statistically significant higher post-assessment performance, F (1, 105) = 19.769, p = .00. The main effect related to the intervention was also significant, F (2, 105) = 3.995, p = .021, but there was no significant interaction between intervention and epistemological beliefs.

  abstract = {The authors examine the interrelation between future teachers' self-assessments of their competence regarding central demands of teaching after completing their training and their pedagogical knowledge regarding the core task of teaching. In view of the high significance attributed to self-assessments in existing studies on the efficiency of teacher training, high correlations between self-assessment and knowledge are expected. The investigation is based on data from the comparative study TEDS-M relating to the participating countries of Germany and the United States. Correlative findings suggest that future teachers with a better test performance were more thoroughly convinced of being well-prepared for teaching. Contrary to the expectations, however, the correlations between knowledge and self-assessment are rather low and only statistically relevant in the case of future German primary teachers and of future secondary teachers in the US. In a final part, implications for the evaluation of the methodological approach to self-assessment procedures and for the professionalization of future teachers are discussed. (DIPF/Orig.).;;Der Beitrag untersucht den Zusammenhang zwischen Selbsteinsch{\"a}tzungen zur Kompetenz hinsichtlich zentraler Anforderungen beim Unterrichten bei angehenden Lehrkr{\"a}ften am Ende ihrer Ausbildung und ihrem p{\"a}dagogischen, auf die Kernaufgabe des Unterrichtens bezogenen Wissen. Angesichts der hohen Bedeutung, welche Selbsteinsch{\"a}tzungen in bisherigen Studien zur Wirksamkeit der Lehrerbildung beigemessen wird, werden hohe Zusammenh{\"a}nge zwischen Selbsteinsch{\"a}tzung und Wissen erwartet. Verwendet werden aus der internationalen Vergleichsstudie TEDS-M Daten der Teilnehmerl{\"a}nder Deutschland und USA. Korrelative Befunde lassen erkennen, dass angehende Lehrkr{\"a}fte mit besserer Testleistung auch st{\"a}rker davon {\"u}berzeugt sind, auf das Unterrichten vorbereitet zu sein. Erwartungswidrig sind die Zusammenh{\"a}nge zwischen Wissen und Selbsteinsch{\"a}tzungen allerdings nur niedrig, und nur bei angehenden Primarstufenlehrkr{\"a}ften in Deutschland sowie bei angehenden Sekundarstufenlehrkr{\"a}ften in den USA statistisch signifikant.

  abstract = {Changing jobs or professions, which is one reported behavioural outcome of teacher burnout (Lee and Asforth, 1990), is a logical method of escape. Unfortunately, large percentages of teachers who suffer burnout remain in their positions (Jackson et al., 1986; Watts and Short, 1990) and may negatively affect the educational process. If the potential negative effects of burnout are to be avoided, it is necessary to identify behaviours that may serve as precursors to burnout. A model is presented here that incorporates a direct comparison between an employee's capacity and job demands (Jaques, 1961). The behaviours resulting from these comparisons are unique and may serve as precursors to the more intense attitudinal and behavioural outcomes associated with burnout (Cherniss, 1980a, 1980b; Maslach and Jackson, 1981, 1986). In addition, each unique behaviour (Jaques, 1961) represents an opportunity to manage turnover better and to intervene in the burnout process.

Using video in teacher education can increase pre-service teachers' ability to apply knowledge. However, video is not effective in itself. To be useful, it must be embedded in appropriate instructional contexts. We investigated the differential impact of two university modules---one using video as an illustrative example (rule-example) and one using video as an anchor (example-rule)---on pre-service teachers' (N\textasciitilde{}=\textasciitilde{}56) knowledge. The rule-example group scored higher on reproducing factual knowledge and evaluating videotaped classroom situations, whereas the example-rule group scored higher on lesson planning. The findings emphasize the need for their targeted use depending on specific learning goals.},

  abstract = {Seit eine (meist soziologische) Theorie der Professionen existiert, ist die Frage der Anerkennung der P{\"a}dagogen, zumal der Lehrer, als Profession strittig. Meist werden sie als Defizitgruppe codiert: als semi-professionals, behaftet mit einem notorischen oder strukturellen Professionalisierungsdefizit, allenfalls Beruf\{\textbackslash{}dq\}, kaum Profession, in der Arbeit an strukturellen Defiziten ohne eindeutige Technologie, ein unm{\"o}glicher Beruf. Die These ist: Solche Codierungen sind weitgehend unbrauchbar, sie verweisen auf die mangelnde Sensibilit{\"a}t der Professionstheorie f{\"u}r das p{\"a}dagogische Feld, sie ignorieren die Leistungen der P{\"a}dagogik und das Potential ihrer Technologie. Deshalb: Auch Professionstheorie muss p{\"a}dagogisch sein, das Gelingen ihrer Praxis nicht als Trivialit{\"a}t abwerten, sondern als Leistung erkl{\"a}ren, die Voraussetzungen f{\"u}r die Praxis des Berufs benennen und die Chancen der Steigerung der Qualit{\"a}t p{\"a}dagogischer Arbeit aufzeigen. (DIPF/Orig.).;;Ever since the existence of a (largely sociological) theory of professions, the question of the recognition of pedagogues, particularly teachers, as professionals has been controversial. They are usually coded as a deficit-group: as semi-professionals, with a notorious or structural professionalization-deficit, possibly an occupation, rarely a profession, who work with structural deficits without clear technologies - an impossible occupation. The argument is: That such codings are broadly useless, they point to a lack of sensitivity in the profession theory for the pedagogic field, they ignore the achievements of pedagogy and the potential of its technology. Therefore: Profession theory must be adapted so that successful pedagogical activities are not devalued as trivial, but regarded as achievements. It should specify the prerequisites for carrying out the occupation and the chances of improving the quality of pedagogic actions. (DIPF/Orig.).},
